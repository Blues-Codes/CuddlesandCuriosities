A Note On Ply
Yarn weight and yarn ply do not correspond. A 4-ply yarn with thin plies can easily by thinner than a 1-ply yarn with a thick ply.

Weight 0: Lace (Fingering 10-Count)
Weight 0 is the lightest weight of yarn. Lace yarn is ideal for making delicate items such as doilies and other lace designs. The fragile and intricate nature of lace yarn requires you to treat it gently in order to avoid unnecessary tangling or breakage. Handle lace yarn with care and you will be greatly rewarded with beautiful and feminine designs you will treasure forever.

Weight 1: Superfine (Fingering, Sock, Baby)
Much like weight 1 yarn, superfine yarn is great for lace and projects like baby clothes, socks, and shawls. The only major differences between this yarn and weight 0 is going to be whatever a particular pattern calls for. They are both so small that you could easily substitute it for weight 0 without noticing much of a difference. If you do this, however, be sure to use the proper needle size.

Weight 2: Fine (Sport, Baby)
Sport weight yarns, or "fine" yarn is also great for baby clothes, socks, and slightly bulkier lace. Many designers prefer to use weight 2 yarn for lace because you can more easily see stitch definition, and it's faster to work. 

Weight 3: Light (DK, Light Worsted)
One of the more popular yarn weights, DK weight (which stands for double knit) is very versatile. When working with this weight of yarn, be sure to cast on and off loosely. Keep in mind that garments made with this yarn might not be appropriate for cold weather, because this type of yarn is not particularly thick or warm.

Weight 4: Medium (Worsted, Aran, Afghan)
Many, many knitting patterns call for medium weight yarn. Medium weight yarn is also known as "worsted." This yarn weight is popular among knitters of all skill levels. Worsted weight yarn provides excellent stitch definition in everything from hats, scarves, mittens, and sweaters. If you knit chunky stitches in a traditional Aran yarn of this weight, the warmth of the fiber can be enhanced. If you're a beginner knitter, you will certainly want to familiarize yourself with medium weight yarn, because it is a mainstay in the knitting realm.

Weight 5: Bulky (Chunky, Craft, Rug)
If you're looking to work up a substantial piece with a lot of weight to it, bulky yarn is the right choice. Materials of this weight produce fast projects on big needles, so you won't need to worry about working on a pattern for weeks and weeks before completion. Chunky scarves, blankets, and throws are perfect examples of patterns that use bulky or super bulky weight yarn. If you are a beginner knitter, using a higher category of weight is ideal, because it produces projects at a quick pace. On the other hand, advanced knitters will enjoy this yarn if they want to create something unique with a novel type of yarn. In order to achieve optimal loft, be sure to knit loose, large stitches. Unevenly spun yarn such as boucle, slubby, or chenille yarn will result in uneven knits, as well as a reduced stitch definition.

Weight 6: Super Bulky (Roving)
We all get a little lazy sometimes, okay? If you're an impatient knitter, like we are, you're gonna fall in love with weight 6. We like to use this yarn when making hats because they're always going to be super warm, and you can make them in an afternoon, like this pattern.

Weight 7: Jumbo (Roving)
While jumbo yarn is not always roving, it's often referred to as roving. This weight of yarn is most commonly used in arm knitting projects and super thick blankets.
